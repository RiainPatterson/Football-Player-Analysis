Welcome to the **Goalkeeper Insights** section of Football Player Analytics.  
Here I post my data-driven findings on goalkeepers ‚Äî from performance metrics to visual breakdowns.

## Post 1: Alisson vs Ederson ‚Äî Shot-Stopping in 1v1 Situations
**Date:** September 29, 2025  

In this analysis, I compared **Alisson** and **Ederson** in 1v1 situations using xG (expected goals) and save outcomes.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Alisson saves **~15% more 1v1 chances** than the Premier League average.  
- Ederson faces fewer 1v1s due to City‚Äôs defensive setup, but his success rate is slightly lower.  
- This suggests Liverpool‚Äôs reliance on Alisson in high-pressure moments is much greater.

**Date:** October 6, 2025  

This post looks at **consistency** ‚Äî defined by standard deviation in save % across matches.  

![Consistency Radar](images/consistency_radar.png)  

**Key Takeaways:**
- Jan Oblak remains one of the most consistent keepers in Europe.  
- Younger goalkeepers (e.g., Diogo Costa) show more match-to-match variability.  
- Consistency may be a hidden strength undervalued in transfers.

**Date:** October 13, 2025  

Here, I measured pass completion rates when under pressure, comparing **Onana**, **Ter Stegen**, and **Raya**.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Onana has the **highest short-pass completion under pressure**.  
- Ter Stegen excels in long distribution but is slightly riskier in short buildup.  
- Raya finds a balance but shows more errors when pressed high.
